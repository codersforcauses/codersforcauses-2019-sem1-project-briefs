# Coders for Causes 2019 Winter Project Briefs


## Introduction:

To new and returning coders, hello from the team. If you don’t know much about us, we’re a student organisation that develops software for not-for-profit organisations (NPOs) and charities, to help them with their compassionate objectives. You can see some past projects here - <https://codersforcauses.org>.

This winter break, we have three very different but impactful projects to offer. Your work on these projects will enhance these different organisations, and their communities. These projects will also continue through to the summer because we want to provide these organisations with quality, products. 

Although the skill requirements vary for these projects, the most important characteristics that we search for with all coders are a willingness to learn, and resilience. That being said, please choose the project that most speaks to what you care about, or are interested in learning about, whether its from a subject perspective e.g. humanitarian work, or to a technical perspective e.g. designing software that uses mapping and geo-tagged locations, or developing a fully functioning website. The teams however will be chosen by a mix of preference and skill requirements.

From completing these projects, the primary benefit will be gaining an invaluable insight into real world software development, because, your work will be used by existing organisations, and it will enhance their user’s experience and in some cases, contribute towards advancements in research, and digital integration for these operations. 

You will also be able to learn and use the programming techniques, and languages that are being used in today’s corporate landscape. Additionally, you will have the chance to work with senior CFC members who are already working in full time positions, who will be able to guide you through the process of planning, and programming a software development project. All volunteering hours are recognised by UWA Volunteering, and the skills garnered from completing these projects significantly increase employability, because it demonstrates a genuine passion for programming, as well as the knowledge of current industry practices. All in all, this is an irreplaceable opportunity from which you can gain, and contribute, an irreplaceable amount.

Below are the projects for this winter, and upon the selection of the teams, we will have client-team meetings;

## Home2Health

In 2012, the ABS estimated that there were an estimated 9,595 homeless people - living in a temporary or improvised dwelling, sleeping out, or in tents - in Western Australia, with the national figure at 116, 000 (ABS 2016). 

This project is concerned with aiding two researchers, Shannen Vallesi - a Research Officer with the School of Population and Health at UWA - Associate Professor and Senior Research Fellow, Lisa Wood -  their colleagues in creating a multi-purpose website to not only host their research, but to create a forum for discussion, and collaboration, for professionals and individuals, to tackle the growing issues surrounding homelessness and health in Australia, and beyond. There are over 80 different individuals and organisations who are interested in the outcome of this project.

This project will help those involved develop and utilise their skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It will serve as comprehensive experience in developing a fully functioning, feature full, website, with image, video, and input integration, and will expose coders to full-stack development.

## FoGUWA App
	
The University of Western Australia’s gardens are listed on the National Estate, and are registered with the Australian Heritage Commission. The Friends of the Grounds UWA was established with the objective of encouraging the UWA, and wider WA community to take an active interest in the grounds via events, publications, lectures, and projects related to the university grounds.

FoGUWA have recruited Coders for Causes to create a map-based application, which will allow users to actively track their location, and that of the plant species on the grounds. The application will allow users to click on specific clusterings of plant species in areas for more information on the plant via the Kwongan Foundation’s Facebook page - https://www.facebook.com/kwonganfoundation/. The primary contact for FoGUWA is Senior Honorary Research Fellow, Emeritus Professor Hans Lambers, a highly cited, and influential biological sciences doctor. 

The project will expose developers to Progressive Web Applications (PWAs), a design system which allows developers to subvert the Android, and iOS app stores (if you’d like) in creating an application, whilst making it compatible on all devices.
	
## LAWRA (Community Legal Services Guide)

Community Legal Centres (CLCs) are NPOs that provide legal, and support services to the general public, with priority given to people who are economically or otherwise disadvantaged, as well as for those who have special needs. Assistance is usually free or low-cost. The client basis for CLCs are oftentimes, like many other ordinary Australians, not well versed in navigating the legal world. 

The Communications Officer for the Community Legal Centres Association, Catrina Campbell-Fraser - in collaboration with a team of UWA Juris Doctor students - has requested that CFC aid them with developing an autonomous program (bot) to help CLC clients with contacting, and receiving service from the correct legal department. 

CLCs annually help more than 211 000 people, primarily covering areas such as domestic/ family violence, family law, and tenancy (National Census on Community Legal Centres).

This project will provide programmer with an opportunity to improve, the quality and efficiency of people’s interactions with CLCs. It will expose students to highly technical programming in automation, and working with the decision trees developed by the Juris Doctor students.


Looking forward to hearing from you all,

Coders for Causes.
